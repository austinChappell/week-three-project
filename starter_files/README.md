The purpose of this project is to get some practice with pulling data from arrays and objects. The data.js file is one array containing objects, Additionally, many of the values of key/value pairs in the objects are arrays.

Question 1 determines the average item price. A for loop is used to get the total, and then this total is divided by the length of the data array.

Question 2 returns all items between $14 and $18.

Question 3 returns the item with a GBP currency code.

Question 4 returns all items made of wood.

Question 5 returns items made of 8 or more materials, incuding the name of the item, the number of materials, and a list of materials.

Question 6 returns the number of items that were made by their sellers.
